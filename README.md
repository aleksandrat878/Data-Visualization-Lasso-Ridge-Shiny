# Data Visuallization Group Project using Shiny app, Lasso and Ridge Regression

The aim of this project is to analyze a dataset of popular songs from Spotify to investigate the hypothesis that the music vibe, particularly the danceability of songs, has remained consistent over the years. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle and titled ["Spotify - Top 2000"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsumat/spotify-top-2000s-mega-dataset), includes a range of features such as year of release, beats per minute (BPM), danceability, and popularity, among others. 

For our research, we focused on the variables year of release, BPM, danceability, and popularity. We used lasso and ridge regression to better understand the realtions between the variables. We ended up the project wtih creating the Shiny app.
