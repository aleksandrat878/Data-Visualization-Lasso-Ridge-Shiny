# Spotify Data Analysis â€“ Shiny App with Lasso & Ridge Regression

This repository contains a Data Visualization Group Project that uses a Shiny app alongside Lasso and Ridge regression techniques.

The goal of the project is to analyze trends in popular music and test the hypothesis that the danceability of songs has remained consistent over the years. We worked with the ["Spotify - Top 2000"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsumat/spotify-top-2000s-mega-dataset) dataset from Kaggle, which includes features such as year of release, BPM, danceability, and popularity.

Our analysis focused on the relationships between these variables using Lasso and Ridge regression to identify patterns and insights. The project culminates in an interactive Shiny app, allowing users to explore the dataset and visualized results dynamically.
